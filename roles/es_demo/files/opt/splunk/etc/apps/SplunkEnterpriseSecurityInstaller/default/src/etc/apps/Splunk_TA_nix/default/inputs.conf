##### Added for ES support
# Note that because the UNIX app uses a single script to retrieve information
# from multiple OS flavors, and is intended to run on Universal Forwarders,
# it is not possible to differentiate between OS flavors by assigning
# different sourcetypes for each OS flavor (e.g. Linux:SSHDConfig), as was
# the practice in the older deployment-apps included with ES. Instead, 
# sourcetypes are prefixed with the generic "Unix".

# May require Splunk forwarder to run as root on some platforms.
